# ✖️ Product of N Inputs – Python Program

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **product of N user-entered numbers**. It uses a `while` loop to take multiple inputs and multiplies them to return the final product.

## 📌 Description

* The program first asks for how many numbers (`N`) the user wants to multiply.
* Then it takes `N` integer inputs one by one.
* It calculates the **cumulative product** of all the inputs.
* Finally, it prints the result.

### 🧾 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**

```
Enter the number of inputs: 4  
Enter number 1: 2  
Enter number 2: 3  
Enter number 3: 4  
Enter number 4: 5  
```

**Output:**

```
120
```

## 🧠 Logic

* Initialize a variable `num = 1` to hold the product.
* Use a `while` loop to iterate `N` times.
* Multiply each new number with `num` during each iteration.
* Print the final result after the loop.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, for example: `product_calculator.py`
2. Run it using Python:
```bash
python product_calculator.py
```
3. Follow the prompts to enter the values.

## 🎯 Use Case

* Useful for practicing **loops**, **input handling**, and **basic arithmetic operations**.
* Can be modified to compute **sum**, **average**, or **factorial-like operations**.
